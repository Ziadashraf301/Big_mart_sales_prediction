* [This project follows the big-mart-sales-analysis project which showed insights and recommendations about best practices to get more sales when opening a new store.](https://github.com/Ziadashraf301/Big-mart-sales-analysis/blob/ef939e3dc1eada7dfff74a0c5a1ad33780c88f7e/README.md)

* [The data was cleaned and organized in big-mart-sales analysis.](https://github.com/Ziadashraf301/Big_mart_sales_prediction/blob/ddd9e0642d25923eefddf1f73824cee31a8d861c/Big%20mart%20sales%20analysis.csv)

    - Decisiontreeregressor
    - Randomforestregressor
    - Xgbregressor
    - Linear regression
* Conclusion:
    - All the models have high R-square and low MSE and MAE but the RandomForestRegressor is the best model.
    - RandomForestRegressor has R-square = 69.3%, which means that these features explained 69.3% of the variation in the item outlet sales.
